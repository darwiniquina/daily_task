# Tasko Mini

Usually when I'm new to programming language I prerfer making a todo app, but that's cliche,
**How about I gamified the task management a little bit, and make it look delightful?**
**My goal? to build something I'm gonna use from day to day (in work and personal stuffs)**

This is my project for reviewing my old vuejs skills after months and years of focusing on back end (Laravel)
